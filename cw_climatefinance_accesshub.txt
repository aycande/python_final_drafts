Commonwealth Climate 
Finance Access Hub
The Commonwealth Climate Finance Access Hub (CCFAH) helps small and other vulnerable states secure 
funding to tackle climate change. The Hub places Commonwealth National Climate Finance Advisers 
(CNCFA) and Commonwealth Regional Climate Finance Advisers (CRCFA) in government departments to 
support with climate finance grant applications, capacity building, policy support, and knowledge generation 
and sharing. As of July 2023, the Hub has helped countries to access approximately US$310.41 of climate 
finance, including $7.88 million of co-financing. This $310.41 million covers 77 projects (32 adaptation, 10 
mitigation and 35 cross-cutting) in 12 countries and the Africa region. In addition to 27 CNCFAs, with the 
central hub in Mauritius (see table below), CCFAH has also deployed two CRCFAs: one covering the African 
region, based at the African Union Development Agency (AUDA-NEPAD); and one that covered the Indo-
Pacific region, previously based at the International Solar Alliance (ISA).

Highlights of capacity building in 2023
Climate Negotiations T raining,  Mauritius
• CCFAH organised a four-round Capacity Building 
Workshop on Climate Change Negotiations in 
Mauritius, spanning 19 April to 12 May 2023. Seventy-
four officials and representatives gained fundamental 
skills for engaging in international climate negotiations, 
covering the Paris Agreement, COP27 outcomes, 
subsidiary bodies, working groups and negotiation blocs.  
Themes included adaptation, mitigation, finance, and loss  
and damage.
Capacity assessment in Nauru
• On 1 June 2023 the Commonwealth National Climate 
Finance Adviser for Nauru organized a stakeholder 
engagement in Nauru to assess climate change 
capacity building needs. The aim was to identify gaps 
in knowledge, skills, strengths and weaknesses, and 
develop a climate change awareness and capacity 
development program.
Climate Finance Writeshop for Castries,  
Saint Lucia
• The Commonwealth National Climate Finance Adviser 
for Saint Lucia and the Information and Knowledge 
Management Officer organised a three-day writeshop 
in Saint Lucia from 13 to 15 June 2023. The event 
aimed to train 18 stakeholders in climate finance, 
accessing funds and developing project concept notes.  
Development partners, including the Caribbean Development Bank, the Inter-
American Institute for Agriculture and the Global Green Growth Institute, shared 
their insights on securing climate finance.

Introduction
Multi-impact scenarios, like those 
the world has experienced over the 
last two years, have heightened the 
inextricable link between humans and 
nature. The contribution of nature to 
human existence and well-being is vital 
and it is well understood that many 
societal challenges, such as human 
health, climate change, biodiversity 
loss, food and water security, disaster 
risk reduction (DRR) and environmental 
degradation, are tied to the state and 
functioning of the natural environment.1 
Nature-based solutions (NbS) have 
gained momentum over recent 
years, as a cost-effective way to 
deliver climate change goals, while 
simultaneously tackling biodiversity 
loss and land degradation. The 
Intergovernmental Science-Policy 
Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem 
Services (IPBES), in its 2019 global 
assessment report on Biodiversity and 
Ecosystem Services,  estimate that 
NbS can positively contribute 37 per 
cent of the mitigation effort required 
up to 2030 to limit temperatures to 
below 2 degrees Celsius, mainly within 
the agriculture, forestry and land-use 
sectors.2NbS can make an important 
contribution to tackling the interlinked 
climate, biodiversity and land degradation 
crises especially in the context of the 
COVID- 19 pandemic and the need to 
adopt green recovery strategies. However, 
to promote low-carbon development 
pathways and resilience across both 
natural and human systems, their 
implementation must be accelerated, 
scaled up and adequately financed. 
This paper discusses financing of 
NbS, providing some examples where 
Commonwealth countries have been 
able to access finance through innovative 
mechanisms and NbS projects submitted 
to climate funds. The aim of this paper 
is to contribute towards learning, 
experience sharing and debate in this 
area, in order encourage further uptake 
of NbS by Commonwealth countries 
for co-ordinated action across the Rio 
Conventions.3
What are nature-based solutions?
The concept of NbS has developed and 
evolved over time, with work and input 
from various organisations, including the 
International Union for the Conservation 
of Nature (IUCN). Nevertheless, there 
is no globally adopted definition of Accelerating Financing for 
Nature-based Solutions to 
Support Action Across the 
Rio ConventionsDiscussion PaperCommonwealth Secretariat28

Knowledge management is a key pillar of the CCFAH model, enabling scaling-up and 
replication of best practices to enhance climate action across the Commonwealth. 
CCFAH develops and disseminates knowledge, experiences and lessons learned 
within beneficiary countries, the wider Commonwealth family and other stakeholders 
through web stories (such as ‘ Ask the Expert’ articles), case studies, insight 
briefs and technical publications, and also through participation in regional and 
international events.
